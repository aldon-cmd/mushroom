You're given a dataset on mushrooms. The dataset contains information on various mushrooms
including whether the mushroom is poisonous or not. Your job as a data scientist is to extract
the data from the csv file and use that data to create a model that will be able to predict whether
a mushroom is poisonous or not (1= poisonous, 0 = edible). There are several steps required
before you do this though. The dataset as you should notice has several columns with letters as
the values, you will need to find a way to convert these to numbers before feeding it to your
model. You're required to train a model and make predictions on a separate test dataset. You
will submit your predictions to a kaggle competition that will be created for you
